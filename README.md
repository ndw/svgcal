# SVG Calendar

This project is an XQuery module for generating SVG Calendars. It runs
perfectly on [MarkLogic 5](http://www.marklogic.com/). It can also run
on 4.2 with the
[ml-rest-lib](https://github.com/marklogic/ml-rest-lib) library.

You can see it
[running live](http://svgcal.nwalsh.com/), if you wish.
